# UFOs

## Analysis Overview: The Truth is Out There
The purpose of this analysis was to create a dynamic webpage to pull and display data on UFO sightings while also making it filterable based on user input.  Multiple filters such as date, country, state can be applied to the search. 


## Results

Webpage link:file:///Users/murph/Desktop/unc_projects/UFOs/index.html

The initial page load defaults to display the data for all entries. This can be returned to at any time by clicking the UFO Sightings link in the navigation bar at the top of the page.

The five input boxes for the search critera can be found on the left side of the page and are as listed: Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. These filters can be applied individually or simultaneously. 

The following image is an example with Oregon entered into the State search bar.

## Summary
This is a great initial start for the webpage design. There are some shortcomings that could be addressed with further development. One of these is the specificity required in the search criteria. A specific day has to be entered, it will not accept input at the month or year level. This requires the user to know the exact day they want to pull and limits the uses of the page. This is the case with the other input boxes as well. This could be remedied by providing the search parameters in drop down menus to select from. However, with the larger ranged date parameter, it would be much more versatile and user friendly to also be able to search by month or year. This would allow data to be accessed on a larger time scale which may provide better understanding in some situations.
